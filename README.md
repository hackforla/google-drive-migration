### FAQ
#### Q: Can’t you just send me the list.<br>
A: Yes, we could, but it we are taking this approach after trying a bunch of different ways because it was taking longer to respond to people who experienced problems with the self managed process than to schedule 1-on-1s for everyone.  Also...
- It always takes longer for the person to move the files by themselves instead of having a 1-on-1 
- Sometimes people put things in the wrong new location
- Sometimes, no matter how much we plan, we don’t get your permissions set up properly before we send you the files, and it's easier to troubleshoot that over zoom.
- Some people have multiple email accounts and although we told them which email these files belonged to, when we sent the emails, they still didn't realize the problem and we had to 1-on-1 troubleshoot anyway.

#### Q: How can I find out more about the google drive migration project<br>
A: Read the [Google Drive Migration One Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lr5UK1k1qR_Ia3KaArQrBPvNhDhFjnBhExX2ssAMLy0/preview)

#### Q: Why can't you just copy the files to the new location
A: We have to move the original files from the old drive to the new one. Please note to not make duplicates of the files, and that you must move the original ones. This is because when we delete legacy content, the links (in wikis and issues) that we have to those files will be destroyed.

For example, - hackforla/expunge-assist#11 has links to several files. This is an old issue and has since been closed, but if these files were needed for reference in the future, clicking on the links will show you a 404 error, and not lead you to the file, if they were duplicated, not moved. There are countless issues like that one with old files that are still important and will be referenced again. Thus, it is imperative that legacy content be migrated from old to new drives, not duplicated, such that we maintain the integrity and ease of access to legacy content. We appreciate your hard work and cooperation.

### Power Tools

[Power Tools - Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/power_tools/1058867473888)

A set of 30+ solutions for daily tasks in Google Sheets.
Power Tools is a Google Workspace Marketplace add-on for google sheets that has a 30 day free trial and provides a multitude of task solutions (30+) through formulated tools. Main toolsets in Power Tools include: Dedupe & Compare, Merge & Combine, Clear, Randomize, and much more.

Example: I was able to combine multiple sheets of data into one with the "Combine Sheets" tool within Merge & Combine. There are also a variety of customizable features I clicked through, including a formula (beta) that updates data real time from source sheets. Reminder that these tools utilize formulas, so changing data or applying a new tool on the sheet you used a tool on will be difficult/not possible.

Once you click add, simply wait for a few moments or reload a few times and "Power Tools" should appear at the very bottom of the "Extensions" menu in Google Sheets. Click it, and a dropdown will appear.  Clicking "Start" will open the main menu with all toolsets. However, you can access tools in the dropdown as well. The "Start" main menu has a menu bar up top, and a favorite tools tab at the bottom so you can access tools quicker.
